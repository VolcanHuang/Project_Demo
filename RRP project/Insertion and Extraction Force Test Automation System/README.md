The system could be decomposed according to encapsulation into five units: computing hardware, robot platform, force/torque sensor, cameras and Database.
## Software Architecture
Based on the hardware architecture, a software architecture illustrated as follow is created to enable the functionality of the system to be realized through interface interaction.

And accoridng to the architecture, the workflow of the whole system is represented in this picture:
